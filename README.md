# React Native Examples

This repository contains most of the examples I've used in blog posts on React Native and Expo. The blog posts are hosted mostly on my [personal blog](https://amanhimself.dev) and elsewhere.

You may find some of the examples being outdated in time, in terms of framework updates or libraries. Don't worry the concept would be the same.

Here is a list of notable examples and the blog post they are related [_if possible_].

- **Description**: In this post, let's take a look at how to integrate Formik along with Yup in a React Native app to create forms and validate them. We are also going to cover how to change the focus of one input field to another using a device's keyboard by forwarding the ref created using a `useRef` hook.

- **Description**: In this tutorial, let's explore a way to create a header view component that animates on the scroll position of the ScrollView component from React Native. We will go through the basics of creating a new Animated value as well as explaining the significance of functions and properties like interpolation, extrapolate, contentOffset, and so on.
